## Goals

- why, when, and how to employ forecasting methods for predicting temporal events, i.e. events that occur over time. 
- evaluate and improve performance of the model. 
- understand the differences in stats based, or parametric, and machine learning based, or non-parametric methods.
- acquire data via: a REST API, Cloud File Storage (AWS-S3), and SQL.
- practice using pandas to operate on dates and datetime values
- address some of the complexities of time series data, including seasonality, sampling, and storing.
- create forecasts, or time series models, using Simple Average, Moving Average, Holts Linear Trend, and Prophet, and Autoregressive model.
- practice forecasting sales (store/items sales data) and learn techniques for working with with time series data like logs (user behavior) or other financial measurements over time.


## Time series vocabulary

- **Temporal:** Relating to time.
- **Periodic:** Occurring at intervals.
- **Resampling in Time Series:** Changing the frequency of your data points.
- **Stationary Process:** Distribution does not change over time.
- **Trend:** Long term progression (increasing, decreasing, e.g.)
- **Seasonality:** Changes in patterns due to seasonal factors.
- **Heteroskedasticity:** Changes in variance over time.
- **Autocorrelation:** 'Regression of self', used to detect non-randomness in data. It is a correlation coefficient, but instead of between two different variables, it is between the values of the same variable at two different times.
- **Lag Variables:** Previous time steps.
